Rick&Morty is an American television series that narrates the adventures of Rick, a peculiar and crazy genius; and Morty, his shy and not very smart grandson. This application tries to show all the different contents of this TV show. You can search through hundreds of characters, episodes, and discover all the planets that create this universe.
 <br>
 <br>
This application was created with the aim of learning new skills of the iOS development environment, such as the VIPER architecture, UIKit framework, Cocoapods, Kingfisher... and more.

## Architecture and Concept

This project uses Clean Architecture and is separated into four main layers:

* **Data**: Contains the repositories implementations responsible for abstracting
  the data source used. In this case, the data sources are a REST API and a Core Data database.
* **Domain**: Holds the business logic layer, which contains the use cases responsible for handling
  the business logic of the application and the abstract repositories. The use cases are the entry
  point to the domain layer.
* **Presentation**: Contains the UI responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling
  user interactions. It also contains the ViewModels, which are
  responsible for preparing the data to be presented and for handling the interactions between the
  view and the use cases.
* **Core**: Contains the common code between the other layers, like the extensions and the dependency
  injection code.
